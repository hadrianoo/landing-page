                <p>Cat intelligence is evident in their ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems.
                    Research has shown they possess strong memories, exhibit neuroplasticity, and display cognitive
                    skills comparable to those of a young child. Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling,
                    hissing, growling, grunting, and body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
                    frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

                <p>Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing,
                    growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.</p>
